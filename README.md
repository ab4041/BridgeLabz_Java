# 8th December 2025

On this day, we focused on setting up the complete development environment required for Java programming.

We installed and verified the following tools:
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Eclipse IDE
- Git

We also checked whether these tools were already installed on the system and ensured proper configuration for development.
